Matrix Grid Visualization is a straightforward React.js project that showcases a grid resembling a matrix, where each cell can be switched between 0 and 1. 
When you click on a cell, it instantly updates its state and changes color for better visibility. This project highlights the dynamic rendering of 2D arrays,
effective state management using React hooks, and conditional styling to create an interactive matrix experience.
